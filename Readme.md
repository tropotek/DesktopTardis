Desktop T.A.R.D.I.S. Project
============================



This repository contains all the files and information
to create a desktop  TARDIS from Dr. Who.

This TARDIS has:
 - RGB LED lights that can be animated
 - A temperature sensor
 - A sound module for soundFX
 - Setup as standalone with fixed animations and sound
 - Setup to use a Java based Desktop UI and control 
   the Lights and sound manually

It's a fun project and can keep you busy when you have quiet times in the office.... lol
