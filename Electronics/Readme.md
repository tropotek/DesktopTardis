T.A.R.D.I.S. Electronics
========================

This folder contains the schematics I used to wire up the sound and lights 
for the TARDIS.

The sound module and arduino mini was purchased from ebay.

A good article on the sound module wiring is here: http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=117009.0
