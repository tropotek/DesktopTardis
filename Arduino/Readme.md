T.A.R.D.I.S. Arduino Sketches
=============================

Here is the Arduino Sketches to run the TARDIS.

You will find 2 lots of code here. 

 - TardisAnimate: Use this code for a standalone tardis that 
   cycles through light animations and sound effects.
   You can modify this as needed.
 - TardisConsole: Use this code if you are going to install the 
   desktop tardis console UI to control the lights and audio manually.
